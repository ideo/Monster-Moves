        Thank you for visiting a Site owned and operated by IDEO or an App published by IDEO. “Sites” refers to Internet web sites and “Apps” refers to apps for use on mobile communication devices such as smartphones and tablets. “Platforms” refers to Sites and Apps collectively. “IDEO” also is referred to as “we,” “us” or “our” in this Privacy Policy.

        <p style="color:#000000;font-family:times;font-size:medium;white-space:normal;">
        <strong>PRIVACY PRINCIPLES</strong>
        </p>
        <p style="color:#000000;font-family:times;font-size:medium;white-space:normal;">
        We understand parental concerns over privacy, especially when children are involved. Because we take this seriously and your trust is important to us, we abide by the privacy policies outlined here.
        </p>
        <p style="color:#000000;font-family:times;font-size:medium;white-space:normal;">
        On our Platforms, we collect personal information in two forms. One form is information that we expressly request you to provide in connection with certain activities. The second form is anonymous information that we automatically collect from your computer, phone or other device.
        </p>
        <p style="color:#000000;font-family:times;font-size:medium;white-space:normal;">
        <strong>Our Privacy Policy is based on the following principles:</strong>
        </p>
        <ol style="list-style-type:decimal;">
            <li>
                <p style="color:#000000;font-family:times;font-size:medium;white-space:normal;">
                You are free to choose whether or not to engage in any activity on our Platforms that involves your submission of personal information, such as your name, email address, phone number or other information that can be used to identify or contact an individual, whether online or offline. We will ask you for such information expressly. Most of the activities on our Platforms do not require you to submit any personal information.
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p style="color:#000000;font-family:times;font-size:medium;white-space:normal;">
                When we ask you to submit personal information, we will explain in the sign-up or collection process how we will use the information (such as requesting an email address when you sign up for a newsletter). We will use the information only as we have stated, other than in Special Circumstances, which are described below (such as in relation to law enforcement or a business transfer).
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p style="color:#000000;font-family:times;font-size:medium;white-space:normal;">
                We use the anonymous information that is automatically collected from your device, such as a computer’s Internet Protocol address, a mobile device identifier, operating system, or general location such as zip code, to support internal operations so that we can understand and monitor the usage of our Platforms and improve the performance of the Platforms.
                </p>

            <li>
                <p style="color:#000000;font-family:times;font-size:medium;white-space:normal;">
                There is no behavioral advertising on our Platforms, which means that you will not see any advertising that is targeted to you based on your combined activity on our Platforms and your activity on other sites and apps.
                </p>

                Third parties that we use to assist with the Platforms are required to follow this Privacy Policy.

                <p style="color:#000000;font-family:times;font-size:medium;white-space:normal;">
                Our collection of personal information on Platforms that are directed to children under 13 (“Children’s Platforms”) is intended to follow the principles of the Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act (“COPPA”), a U.S. law designed to protect the online privacy of children under the age of 13.
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p style="color:#000000;font-family:times;font-size:medium;white-space:normal;">
                We will obtain parental consent before asking for personal information on our Children’s Platforms, unless the request for information falls within an exception that would be permitted under COPPA.
                </p>

            <li>
                <p style="color:#000000;font-family:times;font-size:medium;white-space:normal;">
                We do not make personal information collected from children publicly available nor do we enable children to so on our Platforms. We will not condition a child’s participation in any activity or service on the disclosure of more personal information than is reasonably necessary to participate in an activity.
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p style="color:#000000;font-family:times;font-size:medium;white-space:normal;">
                Parents may contact us (at ToyLabAppsSupport@ideo.com) to review, update or delete any of their children’s personal information that we may have collected and to elect for us not to collect any additional personal information from their children.

            <li>
                <p style="color:#000000;font-family:times;font-size:medium;white-space:normal;">
                We will update this Privacy Policy from time to time by posting the updated Privacy Policy online. We will not change how we handle previously collected information without providing notice and obtaining parental consent, where necessary.
                </p>

        <p style="color:#000000;font-family:times;font-size:medium;white-space:normal;">

        <p style="color:#000000;font-family:times;font-size:medium;white-space:normal;">
        <strong>INFORMATION WE REQUEST ON OUR CHILDREN’S PLATFORMS</strong>
        </p>
        <p style="color:#000000;font-family:times;font-size:medium;white-space:normal;">
        We will obtain parental consent before asking for personal information on our Children’s Platforms, unless the request for information falls within an exception that would be permitted under COPPA. We will explain how we will use the information and use it only for that purpose. Here are examples of personal information that we request on our Children’s Platforms:

                <span style="text-decoration:underline">Share With a Friend</span>. Visitors can provide their first name, a friend’s first name and friend’s email address to send a feature of a Children’s Platform to the friend via email. We use such information only to fulfill the visitor’s request and do not store that information for any longer than reasonably necessary to send the relevant email.
                </p>
            </li>

                <span style="text-decoration:underline">Email Newsletters</span>. When visitors on our Children’s Platforms wish to sign up to receive our email newsletters, we will ask for a parent’s first name and email address. We will send a notification email to the parent and give the parent the option to decline the newsletter. If the newsletter is declined, we will not send the newsletter and will delete from our files any related personal information collected in the sign-up process. If the newsletter is not declined, we will send the newsletter. All newsletters contain instructions so that the recipient may unsubscribe at any time.

        Your information collected through a Platform may be stored and processed in the United States or any other country in which we or our service providers maintain facilities. We or our service providers may transfer information that we collect about you, including personal information across borders and from your country or jurisdiction to other countries or jurisdictions around the world. If you are located in the European Union or other regions with laws governing data collection and use that may differ from U.S. law, please note that we may transfer information, including personal information, to a country and jurisdiction that does not have the same data protection laws as your jurisdiction. By using a Platform you consent to the transfer of information to the U.S. or to any other country in which we or our service providers maintain facilities and the use and disclosure of information about you as described in this Privacy Policy.

        We strive to maintain the security of information but cannot guarantee that information security measures are fail-safe or guarantee that information on a Platform may not be accessed, disclosed, altered, or destroyed. Our Platforms maintain technical and organizational steps to keep information collected secure, including limiting the number of people who have physical access to our database servers and use of electronic security systems and password protections to guard against unauthorized access.
